# Digit_Recognition
Data Mining Final Assignment

# Description:
This application contains a program that trained using MNIST dataset to predict handwritten digits. There is a GUI for users to draw their own digits using mouse. Program can predict user drawen digits.

  Each member have contributed to every task, we didn't divided the project between each other because without the subject integritiy it is not possible to complete a task. Also we all live in same place (kötekli) and we didn't have to use any program to communicate from long distances. We meet up and did the assignment together.

# Usage:
  To use application, simply run predictGUI.py.
  
# Language, Version, IDE
  Python 3.8, Pycharm Community Edition 2020.2.3

# Requirements:
python -m pip install keras tensorflow Pillow opencv-python

# Additional:
    About the commit history; we don't have a commit history of each member because we didn't share our codes on github. It is unefficient and unnecessary to use github to share our code, if we want to share our code (which we don't need because we live in same place) we can share it on an application called discord while we screen share each other. This is our final work after many hours of arrangements. Thats why there is no commit history.
